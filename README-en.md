# Battleship
This repository maintains a [Battleship game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)), which was made to be played on command line.

The project emerged during my second semester at University (2016.1), as an assignment from the course Introduction to Programming Techniques of the Information Technology bachelor degree at UFRN.

The course was taught by:
- Jo√o Carlos Xavier Junior (Theory) - [Academic profile from UFRN](https://docente.ufrn.br/4351681/perfil).
- Andr√ Maur√cio Cunha Campos (Practice) - [Academic profile from UFRN](https://docente.ufrn.br/1363515/perfil).

Fortunately, the project was ... and I managed to pass the course. :satisfied:

# Progress
Regarding the requirements needed by the assignment, the project was completed within the deadline. However, three years later, I decided to dig it up in order to revamp it. Since, as you can see, its implementation isn't one of the best. :grimaciing:

# Instructions.
First, you must clone the repository in any directory you wish. After that, compile the program. For that, you must execute the following terminal commands sequence:

```
git clone https://github.com/giordanorn/battleship
cd battleship
make
```

Afterwards, you only need to execute the program with the following command:
```
./battleship
```

With that, the game will be executed and the menu screen will be displayed on your terminal.
